# Smart feeder
The Smart Feeder is an innovative IoT-based automated feeding system designed to streamline and personalize the feeding process for pets, infants, or livestock. This intelligent device utilizes sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless connectivity to accurately dispense food or liquid at scheduled intervals or on-demand via a mobile app, ensuring timely nourishment without human intervention. Equipped with features like weight sensors for precise portion control, temperature monitoring to ensure optimal food or milk conditions (especially for babies), and optional camera and voice modules for remote observation and interaction, the Smart Feeder enhances both convenience and care. The system is powered by an ESP32 or Arduino microcontroller and supports real-time notifications, feeding history logs, and manual overrides through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity. With its potential applications ranging from pet care and infant nutrition to automated livestock feeding, the Smart Feeder stands out as a reliable, scalable, and user-friendly solution. Future enhancements may include AI-driven adaptive feeding schedules, integration with voice assistants, and biometric recognition for personalized feeding, making it an ideal solution for modern households and smart farming environments.
